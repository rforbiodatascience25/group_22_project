## Introduction

**Our goal**: finding correlation between drug side effects, biological targets, chemical properties.

The project integrates two major data sources, **SIDER** and **DrugBank**.

## Materials and Methods

### Databases

::: callout-note
**SIDER** contains information on marketed medicines and their recorded adverse drug reactions. The information is extracted from public documents and package inserts. The database include side effect frequency, drug and side effect classifications and more.
:::

::: callout-note
**DrugBank** is a comprehensive database of marketed, veterinary and experimental pharmaceutical products, containing chemical various linked database ids, chemical structures and properties as well as biological targets.

### Features

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
-   UniProt names - Biological targets
-   Side effects - most frequent side effects
-   SMILES - chemical structure
-   Lipinski Rule - rule of thumb for successfull medicines
-   State - commercial, veterinary, experimental
-   Indications - target illness or symptom of drug

### Analysis 1 - Correlations

::: {.column width="33%"}
![Reports vs. Frequency](presentation_files/figures/Analysis1_reports_vs_freq.png)
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
![Targets vs. SE](presentation_files/figures/Analysis1_targets_se_correl.png)
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
![Indications vs. SE](presentation_files/figures/Analysis1_indications_se_correl.png)
:::

1: Some common side effects may be generally more frequent

2: Amount of biological targets of a drug show no clear relationship with number of side effects

3: Indications (illness/symptom targeted) show some correlation with number of side effects

### Analysis 1 - Co-occurrence Patterns

![Protein Targets vs. SE](presentation_files/figures/Analysis1_co_occ_targets.png)
:::

1: Infection and kidney disease seem to have most overlap with side effects

2: Breast cancer has low co-occ but higher frequencies

3: We can see what receptors often light up and give the common side effects

## 

### Analysis 2

In this analysis, the correlation between the Lipinksi Rule of 5 and the number of side effects was investigated.

::: {.column width="50%"}
Rules:

-   HBA count ≤ 10

-   HBD count ≤ 5

-   MW ≤ 500

-   Calculated log P ≤ 0.5
